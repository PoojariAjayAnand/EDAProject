# EDAProject
This is my first project. In this project I will analyse the dataset Youtube statistics 2023. The goal of this project is to see what brings success to Youtubers.
For the goal I will analyse the features 'subscribers', 'video views', 'highest_monthly_earnings', 'highest_yearly_earnings'.
Further I will see which category of channels are more successful.
And also check which country has the most youtubers and viewers.
I will see the correlation between the features mentioned above with all the features in the dataset.
Then I will select the features with high correlation.
After that I will start handling missing values and outliers.
Then I will visualise the data.
Conclusion will be based on the information I got from the Exploratory Data Analysis.
